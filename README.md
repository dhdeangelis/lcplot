# lcplot
lcplot â€“ a program to plot light curves of variable stars

# About
lcplot is a command-line program that plots light curves for variable stars using data from the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO, aavso.org).

lcplot is written in Perl 5. It needs the Perl executable and the modules DateTime, Astro::Time, and LWP::Simple, as well as [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) as plotting routine.

# USAGE
To plot visual estimates and V band observations for
a star during the last N days use:

`lcplot.pl STAR CONSTELLATION NDAYS`
 
To optionally highlight observations done by OBSERVER.

`lcplot.pl STAR CONSTELLATION NDAYS OBSERVER`

where OBSERVER is the AAVSO observer code

In both cases the result is a PNG file with the plot.

# EXAMPLE:

This will plot the last 200 days of observations for khi Cygni, without highlighting any observer:

`lcplot.pl khi Cyg 200`

It will produce a PNG image with name "Cyg-khi.png".
